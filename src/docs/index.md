First thing, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ installed.
Colyseus uses some modern JavaScript syntax which are available on version 4+,
so you might possibly need to upgrade.

## Project structure

The simplest way to start a new project is cloning this [template
project](https://github.com/endel/colyseus-starter). And install its
dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/endel/colyseus-starter.git
cd colyseus-starter
npm install
```

Now you're able to run the server, which will be listening on port 3553 by
default.

```
npm start
...
Listening on http://localhost:3553
```
