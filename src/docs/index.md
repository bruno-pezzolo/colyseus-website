First thing, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ installed.  Colyseus uses some modern JavaScript syntax which are available on version 4+, so you might possibly need to upgrade yours.

## Project structure

The simplest way to start a new project is cloning this [template](https://github.com/endel/colyseus-starter) and install its dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/endel/colyseus-starter.git
cd colyseus-starter
npm install
```

To run the server, simply run `npm start`. The server listen on port 3553 by
default.

```
