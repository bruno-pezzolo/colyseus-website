You can always use JavaScript's built-in `setInterval` and `setTimeout` for
simple timing events.

Once those built-in methods rely on CPU load, callbacks may delay an unexpected
amount of time to execute. So you might consider using
[clock-timer.js](https://github.com/gamestdio/clock-timer.js) for dealing with
timing events. This tiny library also provides some additional methods on top of
timers.
